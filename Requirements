Design a homepage for ApprentieMalin — an AI-powered academic support platform for primary and middle school students. The website should follow the visual theme and layout structure of the attached VeVy Chat Bot website (futuristic, clean, engaging, and conversion-focused).

I. General Aesthetic & Style Reference:

Use the attached VeVy Chat Bot site as the reference for:

Page layout and spacing

Typography hierarchy

Background effects (deep gradients, glowing elements, futuristic appeal)

Hero section layout with a 3D/AI mascot

Card-style feature presentation

Section transitions and animations

Testimonials carousel

FAQ accordion

Rounded buttons, soft-glow UI elements, clean iconography

II. Design Strategy Focused on User Experience and Conversion:

ApprentieMalin's goals should guide the structure:

First Impression:

Instantly convey the value proposition: "Smart, Fun, and Personalized Learning Support".

Hero section includes a friendly AI assistant (mascot/character) and CTA to "Start Learning for Free".

Trust & Credibility (For Parents):

A section that speaks to parents about safety, expertise, and platform credentials.

Clean, professional layout using the theme's testimonial and feature section style.

Engagement for Children:

Use the character mascot as a friendly guide across sections.

Consider animations or hover effects to maintain visual playfulness.

Clear User Journey:

Seamless flow from awareness to action: Hero → How it Works → Features → Testimonials → Pricing/CTA → FAQs

Add clear CTAs in each section ("Try it now", "Chat with the AI", "Ask a question", etc.)

III. Section-by-Section Guide (Using Theme Structure):

Hero Section:

Replace chatbot bot with ApprentieMalin mascot (a child-friendly AI tutor).

Bold headline introducing the platform.

Subtext: "AI-based school support that makes learning smarter and more fun!"

CTA button: "Get Started for Free" or "Try the Assistant on WhatsApp".

About ApprentieMalin (Replaces "About Us" block):

Short intro to what ApprentieMalin does (academic support, AI assistant, homework help).

Brief on WhatsApp support, safety, and accessibility.

How It Works:

Use the visual diagram style with circular steps.

Replace chatbot points with:

Start chat with our AI assistant (on WhatsApp)

Ask any school-related question

Get friendly explanations instantly

Practice with quizzes or follow-ups

Track progress over time

Parent overview/reporting (optional)

Key Features:

Use the card layout from VeVy.

Suggested features:

24/7 Learning Help

Friendly AI Tutor on WhatsApp

Curriculum-Aligned Responses

Instant Explanations & Practice

Safe for Children

Multilingual Support (if available)

Testimonials:

Use same slider/carousel format.

Add short quotes from children and parents.

FAQ Section:

Include typical questions like:

"Is this safe for my child?"

"What subjects are supported?"

"How do I try it?"

"Do I need to install anything?"

Footer:

Mirror theme structure.

Add contact info, WhatsApp link, links to "About", "How it Works", "Features", "Pricing".

IV. Colors & Fonts:

Base on VeVy theme (dark blue gradient background)

ApprentieMalin-specific palette:

Bright playful accent colors (turquoise, light yellow, purple)

Use a friendly, rounded sans-serif font for accessibility and approachability

Maintain a futuristic, soft-glow look from the original theme

V. Additional Notes:

Ensure all icons and illustrations are educational-themed (books, light bulbs, quizzes), not techy like server icons.

Mascot design should be warm and kid-friendly (like a robot tutor with glasses or a floating AI buddy).

Every CTA should guide either parents or children toward trying the assistant or learning more.

Prioritize mobile responsiveness and loading speed.
